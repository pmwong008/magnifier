# magnifier
A web-based magnifier instantly accessible to anyone with a browser and a webcam.

## How it works
It is a simple Javascript-based app that captures the video feed from a webcam and applies zoom, filters, and maybe more functionalities suing HTML video and canvas elements.

Simple button and slider controls are included right on the page.

## System and Hardware 
I am building this magnifier with VSCode running on Debian Bulleye OS. The hardware I am using are Raspberry Pi 4B(8GB) with a Logitech HD 1080 webcam.
