# Magnifier
A web-based magnifier instantly accessible to anyone with a browser and a webcam. Future versions will support desktop Linux and Windows as well.

## How it works
It is a simple Javascript-based app that captures the video feed from a webcam and applies zoom, filters, and maybe more functionalities using HTML video and canvas elements.

Simple button and slider controls are included.

## System and Hardware 
Built using VSCode running on Debian Bulleye OS. Hardware items are Raspberry Pi 4B(8GB) with a Logitech HD 1080 webcam, and a DELL 27" USB-C monitor. But it can run on almost any system — salvaged monitors are *especially* good for our environment.

## Why I am doing this
I created this magnifier because my vision is slowly changing, but my passion for slow stitches and fabric detail hasn’t. This project helps me continue crafting comfortably. It’s my hope that others with visual sensitivities — or just a deep love for precision — can benefit from it too.
