  <h1>Why I Built This Magnifier</h1>
  <p>
    My vision is slowly changing, but my love for slow stitches, textures, and fabric detail hasn't. I built this magnifier so I — and others — can continue crafting with clarity and comfort.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a web-based magnifier instantly accessible to anyone with a browser and a webcam. Future versions will support desktop Linux and Windows, and can be used offline after download. 
  </p>
  <p>
It is built using VSCode running on Debian Bulleye OS. Hardware used are Raspberry Pi 4B(8GB) with a Logitech HD 1080 webcam, and a DELL 27" USB-C monitor. But it can run on almost any system — salvaged home computers and smaller monitors are *especially* good for this purpose and our environment.  </p>
